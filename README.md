This Tender Management is more like a science where
each process is to be monitored carefully and more
importantly its created by professionals those who know
the function inside out and have worked on all the levels
of Tenders.

If an organization does not have a strategic sourcing
procurement process in place, then its good to begin
creating one. In olden days the clients will approach the
software companies and make an agreement, so that they
can complete their projects. For completing the whole
process, it results in waste of time and much more
expensive.
